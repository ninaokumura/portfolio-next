            My passion for programming began in early 2021 when I started
            learning HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. At the time I was
            working as an ECE teacher and had just decided to switch career.
          </p>
          <p className="p-2 text-justify  leading-loose md:leading-10">
            Since then, I've been focusing my learning on the MERN stack and at
            the moment I'm looking for my first job opportunity within a company
            that can help me leverage my technical skills.
          </p>
          <p className="p-2 text-justify leading-loose md:leading-10">
            One of the things I really enjoy in programming is the ability to
            bring an idea to life and I am really excited to begin this career
            path.
          </p>

            Now, I am studying React and building my portfolio. When I'm not
            coding, I enjoy being outdoors and bird photography. You can check
            my journey below.
